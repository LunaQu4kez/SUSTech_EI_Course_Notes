### Problem 1

This problem shows a conflict between two moral ideas. On one hand, utilitarianism says closing borders is good because it protects the most people from getting sick. On the other hand, duty/rights ethics says people's right to free movement, promised by the Schengen Treaty, is very important. In my opinion, during a serious health crisis, it can be okay to temporarily limit some rights for public safety. But these rules must be based on science, should not be too strict, and everyone should understand why they are needed.

### Problem 2

**(a)** Act-utilitarianism might say lying is okay if it prevents bigger problems like losing his job. But rule-utilitarianism would say lying is wrong, because if everyone lied to hide mistakes, no one could trust each other at work.

**(b)** Act-utilitarianism might say taking it is fine because it makes her daughter happy and costs the company very little. But rule-utilitarianism would say it's wrong, because if everyone took office supplies home, it would cause big problems and losses for the company. So, the two versions can give different answers.

### Problem 3

In my lab, we have a smart wristband to monitor health for elderly people. To make it better, I designed an experiment: 30 elderly people will use it for one month, and we will ask for their feedback. For ethics, I will: 1) explain the experiment clearly and get their permission, 2) keep their personal data safe and private, 3) make sure they can quit at any time, and 4) have the plan checked by an ethics committee. This respects their rights and safety.

### Problem 4

Ford was not right to use only a cost-benefit analysis. Rights ethicists would say people have a right to life and safety, which is more important than money. Duty ethicists would say Ford had a duty to make a safe car, not a dangerous one, no matter the cost. Rule-utilitarians would say Ford's choice was bad because if all companies put profit over safety, many people would get hurt, which is bad for society. So, safety is a moral must, not just a cost.
